# Chronometer Project


## üï∞Ô∏è Project Overview

This project is a digital recreation of a **maritime chronometer**, scanned with a **CT scanner** and brought to life in **Blender**. The animation created in Blender showcases how each part of the chronometer functions, simulating the dynamic operation of the clock in real time.

The project culminates in a web app built with **Three.js**, allowing users to interact with the chronometer via an intuitive interface, exploring its parts and receiving detailed information about its mechanisms.
